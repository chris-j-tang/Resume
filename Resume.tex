            \item Increased functionality, developed automated tests for GLS's math libraries for conversions from GLS commands to those of various supported object-oriented languages such as C\# or Java
            \item Designed and implemented syntactical flexibility for GLS command conversions to Ruby for certain math commands by adding the base layout for Ruby's unique syntax for certain math commands 
            \item Worked with a Microsoft \acr{FTE} to streamline the core command rendering engine driver by recognizing an unnecessary function called by the parser when preparing to render GLS commands into other languages and removing or replacing all corresponding calls and tests of it in the existing code
            \item Designed and implemented prevention of banned keywords for variable names to prevent users from using invalid variable names by compiling a Typescript key/value map (hashtable) of invalid variable names in supported languages and including a function that returns the validity of a parameter

      \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item Designed and completed a Python script using a HTML parser to automate crawling through Wikipedia articles until the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy}{Philosophy} page is reached
        \item Scraped pages for hyperlinks, and used regex to remove those italicized or in parentheses
        \item Implemented features such as avoiding possible repeats by storing visit history in Python dictionary and including the option of specifying a starting page or start randomly via terminal input
      \end{itemize}
      % Made it a personal challenge to use {\bf{Python}} to access and pull information from the Internet. Around this time, I was introduced to the Wikipedia Philosophy phenomenom: clicking the first
      % non-italicized hyperlink not in parentheses on a page and all subsequent ones, will ultimately yield the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy}{Philosophy} page. Confronted by the difficulty of 
      % not having written Python script before, I soon found out that entire libraries existed for people in my predicament. I ended up using the \href{https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/}{\bf{Beautiful Soup \acr{HTML}}} parser library, which took care
      % of extracting the Wikipedia page's source code for me to parse. I used regular expressions to remove hyperlinks italicized and enclosed in parentheses, and continued the search on the first valid hyperlink. I stored the past history in a hash table to prevent
      % loops, and output the current page the crawler was on for the user's viewing pleasure.
