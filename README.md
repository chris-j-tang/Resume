# Resume

This is the most recent version of my resume. 

I decided that hosting it on github yieded several benefits:

* Publicly accessible -- I can clone my files from anywhere and edit my resume there
* Practice -- By updating major changes onto GitHub, I keep basic git commands from going rusty
* Gave back -- Seeing as the original came from another GitHub repository, it makes sense for me to also put my altered version up as well so @cies and others can see changes I've committed, and derive inspiration from that.
