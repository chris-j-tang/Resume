# Résumé

This is the most recent version of my resume. 

## Motivation

I decided that hosting it on github yieded several benefits:

* Accessibility --- I can clone my files from anywhere and edit my resume there
* Practice makes perfect --- By updating major changes onto GitHub, I keep basic git commands from going rusty
* Giving back --- Seeing as the original came from another GitHub repository, it makes sense for me to also put my altered version up as well so @cies and others can see changes I've committed, and derive inspiration from that.
* Reference --- Allows me to store and access previous resume versions from online, should I need to reference something I deleted with no access to my home PC

## Compilation

After cloning the repository, if you are building on a Linux, run this command in terminal (while in the cloned directory) to build the resume with your edits:

```pdflatex ./Resume.tex```

The resume, complete with your edits, should show up as `Resume.pdf` in the current directory.

## License

Résumé is currently under the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) license. You are able to fork, edit, reuse and review the files in this repository freely.
