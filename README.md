# Résumé

This is the most recent version of my resume. 

## Motivation

I decided that hosting it on github yieded several benefits:

* Accessibility &mdash; I can clone my files from anywhere and edit my resume there
* Practice makes perfect &mdash; By updating major changes onto GitHub, I keep basic git commands from going rusty
* Giving back &mdash; Seeing as the original came from another [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cies/resume), it makes sense for me to also put my altered version up as well so [@cies](https://github.com/cies) and others can see changes I've committed, and derive inspiration from that.
* Reference &mdash; Allows me to store and access previous resume versions from online, should I need to reference something I deleted with no access to my home PC

## Compilation

After cloning the repository onto your local machine, if you are building on a Linux, run this command in terminal to build the resume with your edits:

```pdflatex ./Resume.tex```

The resume, complete with your edits, should show up as `Resume.pdf` in the current directory.
